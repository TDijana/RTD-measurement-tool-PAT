## Background

### Purpose 
- **In-line/ Real time determination of residence time distribution** during extrusion using Uv-Vis as PAT tool
- **Extrusion process monitoring and process characterization** by collecting spectra 
    - In-Line monotoring by Colvistec (unit) = e.g. for multivariate data 
    - At-Line monitoring by ExtruVis (unit) = e.g. fpr univariate data (image analysis)

### Method
- **Tools**: A Uv-Vis spectrophotometer is used to collect spectral data during the extrusion process
